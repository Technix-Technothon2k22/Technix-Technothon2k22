**Technix**

‚ÄúTechnix‚Äù is a college-level technical event hosted by the Computer Department of Goa College of Engineering on 27th and 28th May 2022. Participants are welcomed from any engineering colleges and schools all over Goa. One of the technical events hosted is the ‚Äú24-hour Hackathon‚Äù. Hackathon is an event where people are tested for their ability to solve and build a particular problem/product over a limited time, usually 24 hours. Besides having the added advantage of learning to build something in a short time, it is also a great place to network with other like-minded individuals and industrial experts. There are many criteria which can be tested such as:

1. Ability to work in a team.
2. Ability to work under stress.
3. Ability to develop a product under a time constraint.
4. Ability to solve an unheard/unseen problem.
